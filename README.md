# WIP3DSHB 

This is my first 3DS homebrew and it currently has a few basic features.

 - JSON Parser. It parses a json file from the SD card
 - Button mapped to send HTTP requests
 - Prints on screen, json values
 
Currently, it crashes because I tried to pass a JSON string to a variable and I have no idea what's going wrong. I'm new to C and I'm a total noob. Most of the code was built from examples.
